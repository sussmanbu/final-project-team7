    "text": "This comes from the file data.qmd.\nYour first steps in this project will be to find data to work on.\nI recommend trying to find data that interests you and that you are knowledgeable about. A bad example would be if you have no interest in video games but your data set is about video games. I also recommend finding data that is related to current events, social justice, and other areas that have an impact.\nInitially, you will study one dataset but later you will need to combine that data with another dataset. For this reason, I recommend finding data that has some date and/or location components. These types of data are conducive to interesting visualizations and analysis and you can also combine this data with other data that also has a date or location variable. Data from the census, weather data, economic data, are all relatively easy to combine with other data with time/location components."

    "text": "Where to keep data?\nBelow 50mb: In dataset folder\nAbove 50mb: In dataset_ignore folder. This folder will be ignored by git so you’ll have to manually sync these files across your team.\n\nSharing your data\nFor small datasets (&lt;50mb), you can use the dataset folder that is tracked by github. Add the files just like you would any other file.\nIf you create a folder named data this will cause problems.\nFor larger datasets, you’ll need to create a new folder in the project root directory named dataset-ignore. This will be ignored by git (based off the .gitignore file in the project root directory) which will help you avoid issues with Github’s size limits. Your team will have to manually make sure the data files in dataset-ignore are synced across team members.\nYour load_and_clean_data.R file is how you will load and clean your data.

Instead, you can load in the results of this script, which could be plain text files or .RData files. In your data page you’ll describe how these results were created. If you have a very large data set, you might save smaller data sets that you can use for exploration purposes. To link to this file, you can use [cleaning script](/scripts/load_and_clean_data.R) wich appears as cleaning script."

    "text": "Our Work\nThe data we choose for our project is: Low- to Moderate-Income New York State Census Population Analysis Dataset. The data source is: https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/lmi-tool\nThis data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015. It was collected by APPRISE as part of the NYSERDA Low- to Moderate-Income (LMI) Market Characterization Study. The primary objective of collecting this data was to analyze the low- to moderate-income population within New York State (NYS), aiming to understand their demographic, economic, and housing characteristics more comprehensively. The original source of the data is the U.S. Census Bureau, accessible through the ACS PUMS files. These files can typically be found on the Census Bureau’s website or through specific data tools provided by research and policy organizations, including the mentioned NYSERDA LMI Analysis Tool.\nThe sample population consists of households within New York State that responded to the ACS, specifically focusing on the low- to moderate-income groups. The survey aims to be representative of the entire population, but biases can occur. Also, there are some potential Issues with data collection. For example, self-reported data can sometimes be inaccurate due to misunderstandings of the questions, recall bias, or intentional misreporting.\nThis dataset is used to understand the characteristics and needs of the LMI population in NY State. It supports various analyses, such as evaluating the accessibility of housing, understanding the distribution of income groups, or assessing the prevalence of certain demographic characteristics within the LMI population. We believe the dataset can inform a range of policy decisions, particularly those related to economic development, housing, social services, and energy efficiency programs targeted at the LMI population. Researchers might use this data to explore questions related to socioeconomic disparities, housing affordability, energy insecurity, and the effectiveness of public assistance programs. By identifying the specific needs and challenges faced by these communities, policymakers and researchers can provide programs and interventions more effectively.\nData Cleaning:\nAs per the instructions we checked the size of our data file and discovered that it was larger than 50mb. As a result we worked on the “load_and_clean_data.R” file, cleaning our “NYSERDA_LMI_Census_2013-2015.csv” file stored in the “dataset-ignore” folder. Preliminary cleaning steps included: handling duplicate rows (eliminating them) for the sake of avoiding redundancy and potential biases. Furthermore we handled the one variable that had missing values: “Mortgage Indicator” by assigning missing values to “Unknown” to maintain data integrity and save the variable for future analysis that may reveal some patterns. Lastly we converted “character” types to “factor” types to facilitate future statistical analysis and saved our new clean data file as a rds file: cleaned_NYSERDA_LMI_Census_2013-2015.rds to the dataset folder since it is now only 2.7mb."

    "text": "EDA and visualization\n\n\nBased on the two visualizations above, despite the White, non-Hispanic demographic consistently representing the majority across all education levels, a closer examination of the ‘Average Income by Education Level and Race/Ethnicity’ reveals a more uniform distribution of income across different races and ethnicities. This suggests that while educational attainment might differ significantly among racial and ethnic groups, the resulting income levels exhibit comparatively less variation. Further analysis will be done to evaluate which variables play a larger role in the disparity in the education levels between different race / ethnicity groups. (Our code is in “analysis.qmd” file)\n\n\nThoughts on Statistical Modeling\nInvestigating the relationship between Household Weight and Education Level across racial groups necessitates a thoughtful statistical approach, particularly to determine whether the observed trends represent the core of the data’s story or merely its surface. To delve deeper, we should consider whether these trends offer a complete explanation or if they necessitate further exploration to uncover underlying factors or potential confounders. This exploration could involve examining how additional variables, such as income, employment status, or geographical location, interact with and influence the primary relationship between Household Weight and Education Level. Essentially, the goal is to discern whether the initial trend is the main point of interest or if there are more complex, perhaps hidden, dynamics at play that could provide a fuller understanding of the data’s narrative.\nSince Education Level is a binary variable, we will use the logistic model to find how predictor variables, Household Weight, influence the likelihood of achieving different levels of Education. In this analysis, Education Level becomes the response variable, with Household Weight as a primary explanatory variable, while also factoring in Race. To achieve breadth in the analysis, it’s crucial to examine additional variables such as Linguistic isolation, Households with children, Geographic location, and access to Mortgage indicators, which could influence Education Outcomes. For depth, the interaction between Household Weight and Race in predicting Education Level should be thoroughly explored to understand how these dynamics vary across different racial groups. Data transformation might be necessary to address skewness, scale differences, or non-linearity in the relationships between variables."

    "text": "These are the descriptions of three data sets that we want to work with.\nDataset 1: Death rates for suicide, by sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age: United States - Catalog https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/death-rates-for-suicide-by-sex-race-hispanic-origin-and-age-united-states-020c1 https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Death-rates-for-suicide-by-sex-race-Hispanic-origi/9j2v-jamp/about_data\nThis datasets is about death rates for suicides across different combination of race, gender, age, and years. There are 6390 rows and 13 columns. Each row in this dataset represents a specific combination of race, gender, age, and year, for example, Female: White, or Male:Asian:65 years or order, and gives its suicide rate for the specific group. This data was originally collected by multiple organizations across many years from 1950 to 2019. It’s published by the National Center for Health Statistics. The data itself is already clean and available as a csv file. This dataset is outstanding as it concerns a lot of different demographic aspects, like race, gender, age, and year, which could be useful if we want to assess racial disparities and other issues with intersectionality. For example, we could compare groups with the same race but different gender, or same gender with different races, to explore more about racial disparities and how other demographics influence that. We would also be able to analyze the data longitudinal as it also provides changes over time for the same group. A potential challenge for this dataset could be the inconsistency of entities as they contain different numbers of demographic conditions (race and gender, or race, gender, and age), therefore more data cleaning might be necessary.\nDataset 2: Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks\nhttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mental-health-care-in-the-last-4-weeks\nThe “Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks” dataset comprises 10,404 entries across 11 columns, derived from email and text message surveys. Its analysis is pivotal for investigating potential correlations between access to mental health services and suicide rates amidst the pandemic. However, the dataset poses a significant challenge due to the disorganized nature of its subgroup categorization, necessitating meticulous data cleaning and reorganization. Addressing this challenge is critical to ensuring the dataset accurately reflects the surveyed population, thereby enabling a meaningful examination of how mental health care impacts suicide trends during this unprecedented period.\nDataset 3: Violence Reduction\nhttps://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violence-reduction-victim-demographics-aggregated\nThe “Violent Reduction” dataset primarily provides aggregate data on violent index victimizations in all 22 districts of Chicago at the quarter level of each year from 2001 to the present. The focus of this dataset is on gun related violence; it covers 10 crime types selected by the FBI (codes 1-4) for due to their seriousness and frequency. The dataset is refreshed daily, but excludes the most recent complete day to allow CPD time to gather the best available information. Moreover, it is critical to remember that this dataset is only based on crimes reported to the Chicago Police Department and is not all encompassing of crime in Chicago. Each row is aggregated up to victimization type, age group, sex, race, and whether the victimization was domestic-related. This dataset provides insights into the nature of victims and crime in Chicago and allows the CPD to keep a track of trends across time. There are several opportunities to clean the data including reassigning the names in the race variable and converting certain columns to binary variables. The main questions we could possibly address with this dataset include:\n- How does the rate and severity of violent victimizations vary by demographic characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, gender, and domestic relationship?\n- How does the distribution and trend of violent victimizations change by geographic areas such as police districts, community areas, and neighborhoods?\nWe can also tie this dataset to other available data on the nature of mental health and access to welfare in districts in Chicago and attempt to correlate it with trends in crime. The biggest challenges we might face include a lack of detailed demographic data, limited continuous variables, and some incomplete rows."

    "text": "Dataset to combine: Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages Annual\nhttps://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Quarterly-Census-of-Employment-and-Wages-Annual-Da/shc7-xcbw/about_data\nThis new dataset we found is about employment and wages data in New York state from the year of 2000. It contains employment and wages data for about 97% of all employment in New York, and data is organized by industry and county. For each record in this dataset, which is an employer, it has information about where it’s located (by country), ownership type(private or public), industry, year, average employment number within 12 months of that year, the total wage of all employees, and the annual average salary of its employees. We only take data from 2013-2015 from this dataset since the time period matches with our original dataset. With this dataset, we are able to compute salary data for each county or each industry, and do comparative analysis between states or industries.\nOur original dataset already encompasses multiple perspectives such as county, education level, income group, race, age, etc. It’s hard to find a new dataset that provides a completely new angle to examine it. However, with this new dataset we could further our analysis in the income perspective. Since both datasets has county column, we plan to combine the second dataset to the first one by adding a new column to the original dataset as “average income for the county” calculated from the data from the second dataset. With this new column, we are now able to have a numerous value for income/wage variable to supplement our original dataset which only has factor variables on income. With numerous/continuous variables, we can further our statistical analysis like linear regression and logistic regression.\nWhile the new dataset is based on county-level data, we also plan to do county-level comparative analysis. For example, we could do regression analysis between a county’s average salary and its education level. We could also compare different county’s demographic structure to find out how it correlates with income level."

    "text": "As per the instructions we checked the size of our data file and discovered that it was larger than 50mb. As a result we worked on the “load_and_clean_data.R” file, cleaning our “NYSERDA_LMI_Census_2013-2015.csv” file stored in the “dataset-ignore” folder.\nPreliminary cleaning steps included: handling duplicate rows (eliminating them) for the sake of avoiding redundancy and potential biases. Handled the one variable that had missing values: “Mortgage Indicator” by assigning missing values to “Unknown” to maintain data integrity and save the variable for future analysis that may reveal some patterns. Then we converted character types to factor types because this dataset is derived from a survey and each column should only have certain categorical preset values (except the two numbers are represented in continuous form). It’s also easier for future statistical analysis, and also helped us to check all the values for each column and make sure there is no unusual value for each column, and we know how many levels there are for each column. The output that shows all the levels for each factor/column is attached below to make sure data is cleaned, consistent and with no unusual values.\nAfter these cleaning steps a subset of the clean data (&lt; 5mb) was saved to the “dataset” folder for the sake of having a small data set easy to work with later (can use a larger subset if needed). This subset was created by taking 13500 random rows from the cleaned dataset. Attached below is some EDA work that was done to reveal that duplicate rows and missing values had to be handled:\n\n\nData Equity:\nA limitation of our study is that the data was collected between 2013 and 2015, confining our results to this period and potentially limiting their current relevance. To enhance the breadth and relevance of our analysis, incorporating additional datasets from beyond this timeframe would be beneficial. This approach would allow for a more comprehensive and updated analysis, facilitating broader and more meaningful insights."

Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

(Our code is in “analysis.qmd” file)\n \nAccording to these above two graphs, while the income under 20,000 have high proportion of households, the majority of each racial/ethnic group falls within the “$50,000+” income group. Also, the Asian non-Hispanic and White non-Hispanic particularly have higher proportion of households compared to the Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and Other groups, further indicating economic disparities between racial and ethnic groups.\n \nConsidering other aspects, it seems that White non-Hispanic group still have highest proportions of households. For instance, while it shows a higher proportion of “Own” than “Rent/Other” in White non-Hispanic, the count for both categories in this group is substantially higher (two or three times) than that of the other groups. Similarly, White non-Hispanic also dominates in almost education levels.\n\n\nTentative Thesis\nPotential thesis: Racial disparities are reflected in multiple aspects from education, income, geography, to the likelihood of homeownership."

    "text": "The data we choose for our project is: Low- to Moderate-Income New York State Census Population Analysis Dataset. The data source is: https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/lmi-tool\nThis data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) files for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015. It was collected by APPRISE as part of the NYSERDA Low- to Moderate-Income (LMI) Market Characterization Study. The primary objective of collecting this data was to analyze the low- to moderate-income population within New York State (NYS), aiming to understand their demographic, economic, and housing characteristics more comprehensively. The original source of the data is the U.S. Census Bureau, accessible through the ACS PUMS files. These files can typically be found on the Census Bureau’s website or through specific data tools provided by research and policy organizations, including the mentioned NYSERDA LMI Analysis Tool.\nThe sample population consists of households within New York State that responded to the ACS, specifically focusing on the low- to moderate-income groups. The survey aims to be representative of the entire population, but biases can occur. Also, there are some potential Issues with data collection. For example, self-reported data can sometimes be inaccurate due to misunderstandings of the questions, recall bias, or intentional misreporting.\nThis dataset is used to understand the characteristics and needs of the LMI population in NY State. It supports various analyses, such as evaluating the accessibility of housing, understanding the distribution of income groups, or assessing the prevalence of certain demographic characteristics within the LMI population. We believe the dataset can inform a range of policy decisions, particularly those related to economic development, housing, social services, and energy efficiency programs targeted at the LMI population. Researchers might use this data to explore questions related to socioeconomic disparities, housing affordability, energy insecurity, and the effectiveness of public assistance programs. By identifying the specific needs and challenges faced by these communities, policymakers and researchers can provide programs and interventions more effectively.\nData cleaning strategy: to clean our data we will consider what data types we are dealing with, whether there are any missing values, and whether there are any duplicate rows. Specifically, we will determine if we need to perform data type conversions, i.e. if there are columns that represent categorical data that can be converted to a category type for more efficient processing. For missing values we will see if there are a few particular columns with a large number of missing values and or if there are a multitude of columns with a few missing values in each. In either case we will evaluate what steps to take depending on the importance of a given column to our analysis. Lastly we will look to remove duplicate rows to ensure uniqueness of our data entries which will help avoid skewness in the analysis."
