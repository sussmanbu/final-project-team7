# EDA continuation

To analyze housing characteristics and explore our primary variable Household Weight thoroughly, we also examine the relationship between Household Weight with other factors rather than Education Level, such as Income Groups or Owner/Renter status. (Our code is in "analysis.qmd" file)

According to these above two graphs, while the income under 20,000 have high proportion of households, the majority of each racial/ethnic group falls within the "$50,000+" income group. Also, the Asian non-Hispanic and White non-Hispanic particularly have higher proportion of households compared to the Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and Other groups, further indicating economic disparities between racial and ethnic groups.

Considering other aspects, it seems that White non-Hispanic group still have highest proportions of households. For instance, while it shows a higher proportion of "Own" than "Rent/Other" in White non-Hispanic, the count for both categories in this group is substantially higher (two or three times) than that of the other groups. Similarly, White non-Hispanic also dominates in almost education levels.

# Tentative Thesis

Potential thesis: Racial disparities are reflected in multiple aspects such as education, income, geography, to the likelihood of homeownership.
