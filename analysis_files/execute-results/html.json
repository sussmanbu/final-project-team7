Our project seeks to delve into how these factors collectively influence individual income levels across different racial groups. By examining the effects of household weight — a proxy for household size and composition — alongside the educational levels of individuals, we aim to uncover insights into the socioeconomic dynamics that shape income disparities. The intersection of race adds a critical dimension to this analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of the diverse experiences across demographic groups.\n\n## Motivation Questions\n\nHousehold Weight and Income: How does household weight influence income across different racial groups, and to what extent does it vary between them?\n\nEducation and Income: What is the impact of education level on income within these racial categories? How significant is this impact when compared to other demographic factors?\n\nCombined Effects: How do household weight and education interact to influence income across different racial groups?\n\n## Visualizations of interested variables and relationships\n\n\n\n\n\n### 1. Education and Income\n\n#### Analyzing education level by race/ethnicity\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis percentage-based heatmap offers a nuanced understanding of educational attainment by providing a proportional representation, which allows for a direct comparison of educational levels relative to the size of each racial and ethnic group. For White, non-Hispanic individuals, the percentage of those with less than a high school education is relatively low at 55.1%. In contrast, Asian, non-Hispanics show a remarkable 7.5% holding graduate degrees, which is the highest percentage among all groups for this level of education. \n\nThe statistical implications of these percentages are critical. The data suggests a variance in educational achievement that could be attributed to a range of factors, including economic, social, and cultural influences. The high percentage of White, non-Hispanics with only a high school diploma might reflect cultural issues with higher education, whereas the substantial percentage of graduate degrees among Asian, non-Hispanics could point to a strong cultural emphasis on advanced education. Considering the intertwined relationship between the level of education and income level, this could also suggest why a greater percentage of White people occupy blue collar jobs as compared to Asians. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### 2.

Also, different regions show different impacts on household weight, with some regions like \"New York City\" showing a positive association, whereas regions like \"Central New York\" have a negative association. This suggests regional disparities in economic conditions, demographic compositions, or living conditions. Additionally, with significant positive coefficient for Black, non-Hispanic, this group has a notably higher household weight compared to White, non-Hispanic, suggesting a demographic trend or characteristic prevalent within this group that increases the household weight. Higher education levels (Associate's degree and above), however, are associated with lower household weight.\n\n\n\n\n\n### **Model 3: Multinomial logistic regression with Income disparity across Education, Household Weight, and Race Ethnicity**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# weights:  72 (55 variable)\ninitial  value 556946.929899 \niter  10 value 477887.632429\niter  20 value 467261.034391\niter  30 value 463870.725984\niter  40 value 442500.718578\niter  50 value 424055.356909\niter  60 value 411251.963412\niter  70 value 406690.904482\nfinal  value 406689.281147 \nconverged\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCall:\nmultinom(formula = Income_Groups ~ Education_Level + Household_Weight + \n    Race_Ethnicity, data = clean_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n                 (Intercept) Education_Level2 - High School Diploma\n$10,000-<$20,000  0.17398756                              0.1675598\n$20,000-<$30,000 -0.06279155                              0.4991578\n$30,000-<$40,000 -0.47372010                              0.6912341\n$40,000-<$50,000 -0.69550342                              0.8049590\n$50,000+          0.49187800                              1.1169909\n                 Education_Level3 - Some College Education_Level4 - Associate's\n$10,000-<$20,000                     -0.01431515                    -0.01698338\n$20,000-<$30,000                      0.41785261                     0.59777409\n$30,000-<$40,000                      0.71147581                     1.02226414\n$40,000-<$50,000                      0.90884445                     1.22852616\n$50,000+                              1.47288625                     2.07010428\n                 Education_Level5 - Bachelor's\n$10,000-<$20,000                    -0.2478429\n$20,000-<$30,000                     0.3401299\n$30,000-<$40,000                     0.7879517\n$40,000-<$50,000                     1.1156675\n$50,000+                             2.3950944\n                 Education_Level6 - Graduate Degree Household_Weight\n$10,000-<$20,000                         -0.2369755     -0.002224211\n$20,000-<$30,000                          0.3523127     -0.003644953\n$30,000-<$40,000                          0.8183086     -0.002923348\n$40,000-<$50,000                          1.2770752     -0.005413830\n$50,000+                                  2.9816037     -0.003944505\n                 Race_EthnicityBlack, non-Hispanic Race_EthnicityHispanic\n$10,000-<$20,000                       -0.06600965            0.006152891\n$20,000-<$30,000                       -0.31185696           -0.137885734\n$30,000-<$40,000                       -0.25109052           -0.112421246\n$40,000-<$50,000                       -0.34631296           -0.109406970\n$50,000+                               -0.55132819           -0.253783683\n                 Race_EthnicityOther Race_EthnicityWhite, non-Hispanic\n$10,000-<$20,000          -0.0262662                         0.4407918\n$20,000-<$30,000          -0.1909129                         0.3470999\n$30,000-<$40,000          -0.3580024                         0.4413430\n$40,000-<$50,000          -0.3137825                         0.4573344\n$50,000+                  -0.4733333                         0.3533307\n\nStd.

Education and race/ethnicity are significant predictors of income category, with education showing a particularly strong gradient effect. Differences in income distribution are also evident across different racial/ethnic groups. For example, In general, the coefficients for Black, non-Hispanic individuals are negative across most income categories compared to the White, non-Hispanic reference group, suggesting lower odds of being in higher income group. For Hispanic, it also tends to be negative across higher income group, showing a pattern similar to the Black, non-Hispanic group but with varying degrees\n\n### **Using Anova to get p-value for the statistical significant for each coefficient**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLoading required package: carData\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'car'\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    some\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    recode\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAnalysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests)\n\nResponse: Income_Groups\n                 LR Chisq Df Pr(>Chisq)    \nEducation_Level     44277 25  < 2.2e-16 ***\nHousehold_Weight      257  5  < 2.2e-16 ***\nRace_Ethnicity       2140 20  < 2.2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe output from the ANOVA suggests that all the predictors in multinomial logistic regression Education Level, Household Weight, and Race/Ethnicity—are highly statistically significant in predicting the different income groups.

For Household Weight, the coefficients are very small and negative across all income brackets, suggesting a slight decrease in the likelihood of being in higher income groups with an increase in household weight, though the effect appears to be very minimal. Again, here, Race/Ethnicity also shows significant differences in income distribution, reflecting socioeconomic disparities.\n \n\n### **Visualize of Coefidence Intervals for Education on Income**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhite, non-Hispanic with the positive coefficients in all income groups and an increasing trend as income increases suggest that being White, non-Hispanic increases the likelihood of being in higher income groups relative to the highest income group. \nFor Hispanic, Other, and Black, non-Hispanic, with generally negative coefficients across income groups, demonstrating the decrease in the likelihood of being in higher income brackets relative to the highest income bracket.\n\n\n### **Impact of Household Weights on Income**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe graph depicting the predicted probability of income groups by household weight reveals distinct trends across different income brackets. The probability of being in the lowest income group (\\$0 to \\<\\$10,000) increases significantly as household weight increases, suggesting that larger household sizes may be associated with lower incomes. Conversely, the probability of being in the highest income bracket (\\$50,000+) decreases as household weight increases. For the middle income groups, from \\$10,000 to \\<\\$50,000, there is a relatively steady decrease in probability with increasing household weight, though the magnitude of change is less pronounced than in the lowest and highest income groups. This visual representation indicates a clear negative association between household weight and higher income levels, supporting the interpretation that larger households tend to have lower per capita incomes.\n\n### **Multinomial regression on the impact of Education Level, Race Ethnicity on Income Group**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# weights:  66 (50 variable)\ninitial  value 556946.929899 \niter  10 value 462727.963949\niter  20 value 459141.295292\niter  30 value 431255.553112\niter  40 value 422766.741479\niter  50 value 414504.412298\niter  60 value 406832.529532\nfinal  value 406817.787210 \nconverged\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe graph displaying the predicted probability of income groups by education level and race reveals significant racial disparities in economic outcomes. Notably, the probability of being in the highest income bracket (\\$50,000+) clearly increases with higher education levels for all racial groups, but the slope is steeper and higher for White, non-Hispanic individuals compared to other racial groups, indicating a greater likelihood of reaching higher income levels with increased education. In contrast, Black, Hispanic, and Other racial groups show consistently lower probabilities of being in this income bracket, even at higher educational levels, suggesting systemic barriers or disparities in the conversion of educational attainment into economic success. This visualization underscores the complex interplay of race, education, and income, highlighting persistent inequality in economic opportunities across different racial and ethnic groups.\n\n## Flaws and Limitations",
